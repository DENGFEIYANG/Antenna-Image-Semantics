    "Wrench-like notched patch radiator on FR-4 with a narrow neck and central slot, edge-fed by an SMA connector; partial ground on the backside broadens the impedance match over 3–10 GHz.",
    "Compact mask-style UWB PCB antenna: a notched polygonal patch and short feed neck deliver linear-pol omni radiation with mid realized gain across an ultra-wide band."
