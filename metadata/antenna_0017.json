    "Compact UWB monopole: annular patch plus semicircular parasitic resonator controls the 5–6 GHz rejection while maintaining wideband match from ~3 to >10 GHz; linear polarization with near-azimuthal coverage.",
    "Mask-style concept of a band-notched UWB printed monopole—annular radiator, partial ground with slot, and a semicircular strip that sets the WLAN notch—yielding linear-pol omnidirectional radiation over the passband."
