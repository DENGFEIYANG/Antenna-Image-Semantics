    "Printed log-periodic dipole array on a triangular PCB, edge-fed at the small-element end with an SMA connector; linear polarization, endfire main beam, ultra-wide fractional bandwidth and mid realized gain across UHF/L/S/C.",
    "Microstrip LPDA with eighteen alternating strip dipoles along a central feed line; wideband impedance and directional endfire radiation toward the tip, delivering linear pol and moderate gain.",
    "Triangular wideband PCB radiator composed of a cascaded log-periodic dipole set; edge feed and no solid ground plane, producing a linear-polarized endfire pattern with ultra-wideband response."
