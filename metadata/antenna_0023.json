    "Edge-mounted PIFA on a finite ground plane—shorting path adjacent to a 50-Ω feed and a tuned clearance window; produces linear polarization with stable omnidirectional response over a wide band.",
    "Printed UWB PIFA featuring a top plate–to–ground short and widened current path for broadband match; linear-pol, omni radiation and mid gain suitable for embedded devices.",
    "Mask-style UWB PIFA concept: compact radiator over ground with a controlled shorting strip; broadband impedance behavior, linear polarization, and near-omnidirectional pattern, geometrically scalable to adjacent bands."
