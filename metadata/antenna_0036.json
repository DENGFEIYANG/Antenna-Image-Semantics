    "Low-profile PIFA featuring an L-shaped slot cut in the elevated plate and a side grounding strap; tuned against the host PCB ground to produce linear polarization, an omnidirectional doughnut pattern, and tight FBW.",
    "Edge-mounted PIFA radiator with stamped top metal and cut-out slot geometry; linear-polarized omni response with modest efficiency, strongly dependent on ground-plane size and placement; scalable to C/X/Ku and higher bands by geometric resizing.",
    "Mask-style PIFA topology—elevated plate above ground with a nearby shorting element and short feed neck—achieving compact form factor, low realized gain, and narrow impedance bandwidth suitable for embedded WLAN/Bluetooth devices."
