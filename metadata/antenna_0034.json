    "Compact 24-GHz FMCW transceiver front-end: paired 2×2 patch arrays inside a 20.2 mm square aperture with pin-header I/O; linear-pol broadside radiation and a narrow radar channel bandwidth.",
    "Planar patch-array radar antenna—TX and RX 2×2 grids at roughly half-wavelength pitch—producing a boresight beam of about 80° (az) by 34° (el), high gain, and tight K-band matching.",
    "Square radar module on a low-loss laminate with backside cover; microstrip patches form directive broadside patterns for both transmit and receive paths, optimized for a 180-MHz FMCW sweep near 24 GHz."
