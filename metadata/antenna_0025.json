    "Antipodal Vivaldi tapered-slot antenna on FR-4 with microstrip-to-slotline transition and an SMA edge feed; opposed elliptical flares form a wide aperture that yields linear polarization, a directive endfire beam and ultra-wideband behavior from UHF through Ku.",
    "Planar UWB PCB radiator featuring two mirrored tapered flares and a small circular feed region; edge-fed through a balun, producing linear-pol endfire radiation with mid realized gain over a very wide fractional bandwidth.",
    "Wide-aperture antipodal Vivaldi layout—elliptical/exponential flare pair on opposite copper layers—providing ultra-wide impedance bandwidth and a forward endfire lobe; scalable across UHF, L, S, C, X and into Ku."
