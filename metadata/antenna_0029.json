    "Axial-mode helical antenna on a circular ground reflector: a uniform-pitch metal helix wound on a clear support tube, fed from an SMA bulkhead at the base; circular polarization with a high-gain endfire beam and ultra-wide fractional bandwidth.",
    "Reflector-backed single helix with about nine turns, circumference near one wavelength and a ~13° pitch angle; produces RHCP and a directive forward lobe typical of axial-mode helices around 5–6 GHz.",
    "Compact 5.8-GHz helical radiator—constant-diameter coil above a round ground plate, wire feed through a short vertical post—delivering circular polarization, high realized gain, and broadband match."
