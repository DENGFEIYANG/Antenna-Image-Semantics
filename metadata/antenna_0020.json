    "Small ceramic loop radiator using LTCC conductors and two end pads for feed/ground; requires a host ground plane and matching network; provides linear-pol omni coverage at L band.",
    "Monolithic chip antenna with a top metal loop pattern on a high-εr ceramic block; narrow-band L-band tuning, linear polarization, and low gain typical of embedded GNSS antennas.",
    "SMD ceramic loop element oriented along the board edge—tuned for 1.575 GHz with external LC matching; delivers near-azimuthal coverage (omni), linear pol, and narrow FBW suitable for compact GNSS devices."
