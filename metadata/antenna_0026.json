    "3D-printed double-ridged horn antenna with a coax feed at the backplate and tapered inner ridges guiding the field to a flared rectangular aperture; linear polarization, broadside main lobe, ultra-wide 2–8 GHz coverage and high gain.",
    "Broadband ridged horn—exponential ridge pair inside a rectangular flare—metallized interior surfaces and SMA back feed; produces a directive broadside beam with linear polarization and wide fractional bandwidth across S/C bands.",
    "Compact double-ridge horn geometry with a small ridge gap at the throat that expands toward the mouth; high-directivity broadside radiation, linear pol, and ≈120% FBW centered near 5 GHz."
