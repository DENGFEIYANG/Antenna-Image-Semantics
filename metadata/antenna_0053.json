    "Shielded BLE module with a corner meandered inverted-F antenna etched on the PCB; linear polarization, near-omnidirectional pattern and narrow 2.4-GHz ISM bandwidth with low realized gain.",
    "Embedded PCB IFA next to the RF shield can, fed through a 50-ohm pad and small matching network; performance depends on host board ground and a ~5-mm metal keep-out around the antenna edge.",
    "Compact on-module Bluetooth antenna using a folded IFA trace to fit the 2.402–2.480 GHz band; produces linear-pol omni coverage with ~1–2 dBi peak gain on the reference layout."
