    "Cloverleaf-style circularly polarized omni antenna for the C band: four bent-wire petals arranged in a skew planar geometry above a small circular ground disc, fed through a vertical post from an SMA bulkhead.",
    "Skew-planar CP radiator with four curved loops phased for right-hand circular polarization; low-profile ground disc suppresses back radiation while maintaining a near-omnidirectional doughnut pattern and wide fractional bandwidth around 5–6 GHz.",
    "Bent-wire CP omni with a central feed post and symmetric petal loop set; RHCP operation, low realized gain, and wide matching bandwidth typical of FPV cloverleaf designs."
