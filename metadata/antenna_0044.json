    "Bi-quad antenna made from two square wire loops mounted above a square metal reflector on a short standoff; linear polarization, directional broadside beam, wide fractional bandwidth and ~10 dBi gain at 2.4 GHz.",
    "Dual-square wire radiator fed at the center junction with an SMA bulkhead through the reflector; standoff about one-eighth wavelength and square sides near a quarter wavelength to tune the S-band ISM channel.",
    "Reflector-backed wire bi-quad on a small plate—two diamond-shaped loops in free space—producing a linear-polarized broadside main lobe, ~18% FBW, and high realized gain for Wi-Fi links."
