    "28-GHz Ka-band phased array: a 1×16 line of microstrip patches at ~0.5-λ pitch with dual 2.4-mm edge connectors feeding corporate networks; linear polarization, broadside/scannable beam and ~19 dBi realized gain.",
    "Slim mmWave PCB module featuring sixteen half-wavelength-spaced patch elements over a solid ground; narrow azimuth HPBW (~10°) and a broad elevation pattern set by the element.",
    "Ka-band patch array for 5G FR2—two corporate feed trees provide phase access for ±45° electronic steering while maintaining medium FBW (~12%) and very-high array gain."
