    "UWB printed monopole using a stepped-taper patch fed by a 50-ohm microstrip above a truncated ground; linear polarization, near-omnidirectional pattern, and ~131% fractional bandwidth spanning S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka.",
    "Square PCB radiator with a multi-step taper that broadens the impedance match; partial ground on the back and a short feed neck to an edge SMA create a wide passband with mid realized gain.",
    "Mask-style UWB patch monopole—large flared plate shaped by four discrete steps—delivering linear-pol omni radiation and deep return-loss minima near ~5.6 GHz within a 3–10 GHz band."
