    "Dual-band printed monopole with a rectangular loop radiator and two inner parallel strips that form long and short current paths, yielding resonances at 2.4 and 5.5 GHz; linear polarization and near-omnidirectional pattern.",
    "Microstrip-fed loop monopole on FR-4 with a rear partial ground and a narrow feed neck; the embedded twin strips set the higher-band resonance while the outer loop tunes the lower band.",
    "Compact dual-resonant PCB antenna: rectangular loop frame plus two inner stubs for 2.4/5 GHz operation, fed by a 50-ohm microstrip over a truncated ground to maintain omni coverage."
