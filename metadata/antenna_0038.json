    "Thin-laminate UWB PCB antenna featuring a square monopole plate and edge SMA feed; the ground plane is truncated and T-shaped slotted to control current return, giving linear-polarized omnidirectional radiation over multiple bands.",
    "Printed monopole topology with a square radiator and close ground clearance; T-slot ground loading enhances low- and high-end bandwidth symmetry, achieving mid gain and stable omni response from S through Ka when scaled.",
    "Planar UWB monopole: square front patch, microstrip feed, and a rear partial ground incorporating a T-slot resonator; delivers linear polarization, ≈ultra-wide FBW, and near-omnidirectional patterns suitable for broadband sensing and links."
