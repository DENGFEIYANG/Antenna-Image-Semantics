    "SMD ceramic antenna integrating GNSS and Wi-Fi in one body—patch region plus auxiliary metallization for the higher band; dual-pol capability with a broadside boresight, mid gain, and narrowband behavior; performance dependent on the host ground plane.",
    "Top-metallized LTCC chip with distinct GNSS and Wi-Fi resonant sections sharing a common feed and reference; compact footprint, broadside radiation, dual polarization, narrow FBW, and gain in the mid class for embedded devices.",
    "Ceramic chip combo antenna: GNSS L1 patch-like radiator co-located with an S-band element; tuned for SMD assembly above a ground plane; exhibits a broadside main lobe, dual polarization, moderate gain, and band-specific narrow impedance bandwidths."
