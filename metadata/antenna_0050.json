    "Broadband quad-ridged horn with two orthogonal coax ports providing dual-linear polarization; aluminum flare yields a directive broadside beam and ~15 dBi gain across 2–18 GHz.",
    "Dual-port ridged horn antenna covering S through Ku bands with ultra-wide fractional bandwidth; typical VSWR under ~2.5:1 and strong port isolation with >20 dB cross-pol discrimination.",
    "Lightweight aluminum horn (≈185 × 170 × 170 mm) with 2×2.92 mm connectors and 50 W rating; produces a stable broadside pattern and high realized gain over decade bandwidth."
