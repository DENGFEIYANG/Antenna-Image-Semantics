    "LTCC ceramic PIFA chip antenna for WLAN/Bluetooth; end-pad feed and SMT mounting on a host ground plane; linear polarization, omnidirectional pattern, narrow fractional bandwidth and low realized gain, scalable across L/S/C bands.",
    "Compact ceramic patch-PIFA with patterned metallization and an internal shorting path; requires external matching to 50 Ω and edge clearance on the PCB; provides near-omnidirectional radiation with linear polarization and narrow-band behavior.",
    "SMD PIFA chip radiator—small ceramic body with top/side metal and two-terminal feed/ground—operating over a ground plane to yield linear polarization, low gain, and narrow FBW suitable for Bluetooth/Wi-Fi in the S band, extendable via geometric scaling."
