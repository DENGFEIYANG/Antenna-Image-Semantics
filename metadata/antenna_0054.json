    "Stamped-metal 2.4 GHz PIFA with a meandered top plate and vertical short, edge-mounted above the host ground plane; linear polarization, near-omnidirectional radiation, narrow FBW and mid realized gain.",
    "Compact internal PIFA—folded radiator on 0.3-mm sheet with a 90° bend and a single 50-ohm feed tab—covering 2400–2485 MHz with VSWR < 1.7 and ~62% efficiency on the reference board.",
    "Edge-mount inverted-F radiator where the overall loop length tunes the 2.45-GHz resonance; performance depends on PCB ground and matching network, yielding linear-pol omni coverage."
