    "Ka-band mmWave phased-array module: a 3×4 microstrip patch grid on a Rogers laminate with corporate feeding and integrated beamforming ICs, offering dual polarization, broadside/directable beams and medium fractional bandwidth around 28/39 GHz.",
    "Rectangular PCB tile featuring twelve Ka-band patch elements at roughly half-wavelength pitch; dual-pol array with solid backside ground and electronic beam steering to ±45°, delivering very-high realized gain for 5G FR2.",
    "Compact mmWave patch-array module for 5G—dual-polarized elements in a 3 by 4 layout with corporate feed and beamform control—providing a directive broadside beam, steerable coverage and ~17 dBi tile gain across Ka."
